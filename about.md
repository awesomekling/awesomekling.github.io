Hi! I'm Andreas Kling, a lifelong programming enthusiast and aspiring generalist. I'm currently working on [SerenityOS](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/), a from-scratch operating system that tries to make Unix fun again.

I've been writing C++ for many years at companies both big and small. There's a pretty good chance you're reading this in a browser that's slightly faster because of me. ;)

### YouTube

I regularly upload screencasts of me working on SerenityOS to [my YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/AndreasKling). I'm also doing a series of informal ["commute talks"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMOpZvQB55beZVZnnck4Q-J9nVQP6ihVP) in the car where I discuss random programming topics or tell (hopefully) interesting stories about jobs I've had.

There's no flashy editing or jumpcuts, it's all raw footage minus the occasional extremely loud sneeze or cough.

### Donations / support

I've started accepting monthly donations via Patreon since many people were interested in funding my work on SerenityOS. It's amazing that people are willing to support such a crazy project, and it's making me wonder just how far we can take this. [Check out my Patreon!](https://patreon.com/serenityos)

As of October 2019, I'm also in the [GitHub Sponsors program](https://github.com/sponsors/awesomekling/) as well.

Finally I also accept one-time donations [via Paypal](https://paypal.me/awesomekling) for anyone who prefers that.

### Contact me

You can find me on Twitter as [@awesomekling](https://twitter.com/awesomekling)

If you want to talk about SerenityOS, come to [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/29gCcKsXkF) and meet the whole community!

I'm also available via e-mail, although I get a lot of it, so I appreciate short and to-the-point messages :^) [kling@serenityos.org](mailto:kling@serenityos.org)
